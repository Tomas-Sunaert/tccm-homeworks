This is Mauro's implementation of the exercise. It contains three module files which contain relevant subroutines for the dense handeling, sparse handeling and another one thats related to the calling the relevant functions in the main program. Then we have the main program (compare_matmul.f90). To use it, simply call the executable followed by the path to the matrices and its size. We assume we are dealing with square symmetric matrices (of the sae size). The output simply gives the number of multiplications and wall time of the calculation for each method. Aditionally, we can ask it to print the matrices by adding a non-0(empty) last argument when calling it:
./compare_matmul <path/to/file1> <path/to/file2> size <0 for not printing | 1 to print>
