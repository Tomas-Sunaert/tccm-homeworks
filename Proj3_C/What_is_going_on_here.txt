This file explains what i'm doing

I have broken up the problem in many digestable functions.

Then I'll try to test one by one to see if they behave as expected, putting them in the 'test.c' file and compiling.

Since I'm personally not very familiar with C, I want to see and correct compiling erorrs one by one.
