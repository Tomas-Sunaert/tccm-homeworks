INSTALLING THE PROGRAM:

In the folder src you'll find many files with extention .h and .c, make sure to keep them in the same folder if you copy them.

Generate a executable file by compilind the .c file with:
 gcc Final.c -o Program.out

Then, from tests you'll find some examples of inputs as "input.txt" or "input2.txt". Make sure they are in the same directory as the one where is the executable file you have just compiled.
